The public directory is intended for static files such as images, icons, or other assets that can be served directly. Since you haven't specified any particular static files to include, I will create a placeholder file structure for you. You can add your static files later as needed.

Here are the contents for the file: /home-sweet-home/home-sweet-home/public/(static files)
